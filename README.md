Project: Greenvalley (onlineenrollment system)

About system:
An Online Enrollment System for students in PHP is the process of software and web based application which organizations, and educational establishments used to manage and process individual’s admission. Usually, it requires gathering and organizing record of appropriate information on individuals/students, which includes personal information, academic semester, course preferences, expenses, and other related data.

How the System Work:  
This contains two sides which are the Public side and the Admin Side. This is so very easy to use that students or parents can easily and quickly complete the forms provided even on their mobile phones. There’s no need for them to go to the school to enroll now, it’s very convenient for the parents or students to enroll online. Here, PayPal is used as a mode of payment so the students can pay the fees in seconds.
